Lessons Learned:

The most important thing I learned was how to efficiently setup my workspace and work as a team with my companion. I used Git and Trello to easily organize my workflow and always know what to work on next. The project was also a great lesson on using template languages, implementing database and authorization, and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript efficiently.
